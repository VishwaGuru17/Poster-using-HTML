        Why soil matters
    </div>
    <div class="reason">
    Soil is the basis for sustenance for 7 billion people. 
    It preserves clean water and helps regulate the climate. 
    Soil degradation reduces agricultural yields and threatens farmers' livelihoods.
    Soil that has been leached of its nutrients cannot support crops, or plants that prevent desertification. 
    Healthy soil is essential to ensure a steady supply of food and biodiversity.
